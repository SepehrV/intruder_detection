#intruder detection by Sepehr Valipour 

This project is done as a part of IoT course. 
The system is consist of a Raspberry Pi, Motion sensor and a camera.
Motion sensor and camera are locally connected and whenever a motion is detection by the motion sensor, camera shoots a picture.
There is web server running on RPi that hosts a website (sepehr-rpi.crabdance.com) and publishes the motion sensor data and last image of a detected motion.
